“I love public speaking! In college at UPenn, I was the National Debate Champion. At Harvard Law School, I was a moot court champion. And in my career, I’ve argued 10 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court + regularly appeared on television. https://stris.com/mcdougal/. High school debate changed my life. Because of amazing coaches, I learned to find my own voice. And I’m eager to pay it forward by working with a new generation of talent at WHS!”

“As a Cerritos High School student in the 1990s, I was first introduced to public speaking through Model United Nations. I went on to debate in college for Cal (UC Berkeley – Go Bears!) and enjoyed it even more, making friendships that have lasted decades. Having spent the past 20+ years as a practicing lawyer and law professor, I’ve frequently drawn upon the skills that I developed as a college debater. I’m excited to help impart those foundational skills to you all!”
